In Gujarat's heart, where rivers flow, A leader rose, with vision to show. Narendra Modi, a name so bold, A politician, with stories untold.

From a businessman to the Prime Minister's throne, He walked the path, of a journey unknown. With a message of change, and a call to unite, He won the hearts, of many an Indian's sight.

His campaign promises, of growth and prosperity too, Resonated with many, who sought a new view. Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, a movement so grand, Clean India, a dream he took in hand.

The Goods and Services Tax, a reform so bold, A step towards nation-building, to be told. Make in India, a mantra so bright, To boost the economy, and shine with all its might.

Love for India, a feeling so true, He showed his heart, through all he'd do. From Ayodhya to Kashmir's borders wide, His commitment to unite, and heal the divide.

Yet, like any leader, his path was not without strife, Critics and controversies, a constant life. But still he persevered, with courage in his soul, A legacy builder, with a nation's goal.

Today, as Prime Minister, he stands tall and proud, A leader of India, with a story avowed. His name etched in history, for what he's done, A chapter unfolding, for the Indian people, begun.
